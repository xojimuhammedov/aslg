# AI-Agent-Friendly Starter Template

This repository is a ready-to-use boilerplate/template for setting up an AI-agent-friendly developer ecosystem (documentation, lintable rules, and repeatable workflow skills) for any project.

You can clone this repository, push it to your own GitHub, or merge its files directly into your existing projects.

## How to Implement in Your Project

### Option A: Use as a GitHub Template (For new projects)

1. Use this repository as a template on GitHub to create a new repo.
2. Run `npm install` or `pnpm install` to set up the rules symlink synchronization automatically.
3. Tailor `AGENTS.md` and the rules under `.agents/rules/` to fit your project.

### Option B: Merge into an Existing Project

Copy the files into your current workspace:

```bash
# Copy agents config, scripts, rules, skills, and docs
cp -R .agents AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/
```

Then, update your project's `.gitignore` and `package.json` to match the configuration templates provided in this repo.

## Synchronizing Rules

Agent harnesses (like Cursor and Claude Code) expect rules at and `.claude/rules`. To keep rules centralized in one place (`.agents/rules/`) without duplication:

```bash
# Generate the IDE symlinks automatically
pnpm rules:sync

# Check if rules are in sync (runs on CI)
pnpm lint:rules:symlinks
```

These symlinks are gitignored to keep the repository history clean.
